SCENARIO:

Imagine we work in the management office for an organization with Sales, Ops & Finance departments. 
Our organization has 3 grades namely G1, G2, G3.  Help us write queries to answer the questions below.
 
Table details: 
All employees: 
-	A summary table with employee details. You can assume employee_idâ€™s are unique to each employee
 and there are no duplicates in the table. 
-	Columns : empId | empName | dept | grade 
Project details: 
-	This contains the project details. Each project has been assigned to only one employee and 
the project duration is also captured 
-	Columns : project_id | empId | duration 
 
Questions: 

1.	How many employees  are there in each department? 

Ans- select dept, count(empName) as employee_count
         from EMPLOYEE
         group by dept;

2.	Which department has the maximum number of G1, G2 & G3 employees respectively? 

Ans- select grade, max(cnt), dept
      From (
                 select dept,grade, count(grade) as cnt
                 from EMPLOYEE
                 group by dept,grade)
          group by grade;

3.	What is the average project completion time per department (in descending order)? 

Ans- select e.dept, round(avg(p.duration),2) as average
         From    EMPLOYEE e
     join 
     PROJECT p
     on 
     e.empId = p.empId
        group by e.dept
        order by average desc;

4.	List down all the employees whose project duration is more than the average
 of their respective departments? 

Ans- select empName
from (
    with j_tbl as(
        select *
        from EMPLOYEE e
             join 
             PROJECT p
             on 
             e.empId = p.empId)
    select *,
        avg(duration) over (partition by dept) as avrg
    from j_tbl
    order by dept) s
where s.duration > s.avrg;

5.	Based on the least project duration the company decided to reassign grades G1 being most superior 
then G2 followed by G3, with the project duration info assign new grades to the employees?  

Ans-
select empId, empName, dept,
       case
            when rnk = 1 then "G1"
            when rnk = 2 then "G2"
            else "G3"
       end as new_grades
from(
     select *,
        rank() over (partition by dept order by duration asc) as rnk
            from EMPLOYEE e
                 join 
                 PROJECT p
                 on 
                 e.empId = p.empId
     order by e.dept);
